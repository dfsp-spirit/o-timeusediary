============================


Current WIP
-----------

Version 0.2.0 -- Display data from JSON
---------------------------------------
* Support loading and displaying data from JSON
  - currently this is a demo, to see it you need to set URL parameter preload=1 when loading the app
* FIX: fix computation of endMinutes, it was not updated when resizing bars in timeline, so always was 10 minutes after start (the default length is 10 minutes when adding)



Version 0.1.0 -- Support custom activites on top and child level
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Add support for custom activities, which are not dependent on parsing the activity name, but uses new  'is_custom_input' field in JSON
